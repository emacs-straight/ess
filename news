Changes and New Features in 25.01.0:

   • polymode: In our transition from literate libraries (such as noweb
     documented below with respect to 19.04), we now recommend the
     polymode packages as a more suitable replacement.  Furthermore, we
     suggest the related polymodes including poly-noweb, poly-markdown
     and poly-R (installed in that order).  The package polymode itself,
     as well as the polymodes packages, are all on MELPA rather than
     ELPA. Therefore, you need to add MELPA to the list of installation
     archives as follows.  ‘(add-to-list 'package-archives
     '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))’ for ‘M-x
     package-install’

   • ESS[R]: The shorthand notation for lambda functions and the
     question mark are now fontified as keywords.  Contributed by Maxime
     Pettinger.

   • ESS[SAS]: Developed new comprehensive lists of PROCs and functions
     for syntax highlighting.  See ‘etc/proc.sas’ and ‘etc/func.sas’.

   Changes and New Features in 24.01.1:

   • Revert a bug introduced with the ‘ess-request-a-process’ change

   Changes and New Features in 24.01.0:

   • fix docstring warnings in ess-custom

   • :package-version is now set to "VERSION" in ess-custom.  By make
     this is replaced with "24.01.0" (or similar).

   • Better "collaboration" with org-mode.  Now ‘ess-request-a-process’
     obeys ‘ess-gen-proc-buffer-name-function’, thanks to Ihor
     Radchenko.

   Changes and New Features in 19.04 (unreleased):

   • ESS[R]: When a background command is interrupted with C-g, ESS now
     asks the user if they want to disable background evaluations
     altogether.  This is a resiliency measure against cases where
     background evals cause cascading errors or hangs.

   • ESS[R]: Background commands now propagate errors to Emacs.

   • ESS[R]: Background commands can now be disabled by process instad
     of globally.  For instance when a process has failed to initialize
     properly, background evals are disabled for that particular process
     to avoid cascading errors.  Other processes may still use
     background commands.

   • ESS[R]: ESSR commands are now more robust when ESSR is not in
     scope.  This can happen when using ‘browser()’ in an environment
     that doesn't inherit from the search path.

   • ESS[R]: Unexpected exits are now detected during startup.  In that
     case an error is thrown with advice about how to recover.

   • ESS[R]: ‘options(width = )’ is now set on startup based on the
     width of the inferior window.

   • ESS[R]: Add support for R projects and start R by default in the
     project folder.

   • ESS[R]: Backticked symbols in the process buffer are no longer
     fontified as strings.

   • ESS[R]: ‘ess-command’ now runs R code in a sandboxed environment.
     Use ‘.ess.environment()’ to inspect the current environment.

   • ESS[R]: Added support for new syntax in R 4.0 and R 4.1.  This
     concerns raw strings, lambda functions, and the pipe operator.

   • ESS[R]: Highlight error locations in rlang style backtraces

   • ESS[R]: Fixed issue that caused ESS-help to hang when usage blocks
     include R comments (#1025).  Fix contributed by Bill Evans.

   • ESS: New ‘ess-elisp-trace-mode’ minor mode.  Toggle it to start or
     stop tracing all ‘ess’-prefixed functions with ‘trace-function’.
     Tracing is useful for debugging background ESS behaviour.

   • ESS[R]: ‘ess-get-help-aliases-list’ now caches the aliases on the R
     side.  This should speed up help lookup when the search path has
     changed and the aliases are read again.

   • ESS: ‘ess-command’ now uses a default timeout of 30 seconds.  It
     should normally be avoided with long-running tasks because it
     causes Emacs to block while the command is running.  If the timeout
     is reached, an error is thrown.  An interrupt is also sent to the
     process in case of early exit.

     This is a behaviour change: you will now have to explicitly opt in
