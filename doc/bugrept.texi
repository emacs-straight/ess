Please post bug reports, suggestions etc.
on our @uref{https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/issues, github issue
tracker}; if not possible, e-mail them to @email{ESS-help@@r-project.org}.

The easiest way to set this up, is within Emacs by typing

@kbd{M-x ess-submit-bug-report}

This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem.
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET".  Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.
